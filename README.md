## 🚀 Dashboard Overview

This dashboard consolidates **policy and claims data** into a single interactive view with filters for:
- Month of Claim Date  
- Product Line (Auto, Homeowners, Commercial, Property, Agriculture)  
- Claim Severity (Minor, Moderate, Major)  
- State (CA, WA, OR, AZ, NV)  
- Claim Status (Paid, Open, Denied)  

It allows stakeholders to drill down from the **portfolio level** to **specific product lines or states** to uncover risk drivers and profitability insights.
